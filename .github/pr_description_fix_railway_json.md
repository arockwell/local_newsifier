# Fix Railway Deployment Configuration with Proper Python Package Structure

## Description

This PR updates the Railway deployment configuration to use Python's native package system rather than relying on pip installation or PYTHONPATH. The initial PR removed `pip install -e .` but led to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'local_newsifier'`, and the subsequent PYTHONPATH approach also encountered issues in deployment.

## Problem

The project uses a src-layout structure (`packages = [{include = "local_newsifier", from = "src"}]` in pyproject.toml), which creates import path challenges when deployed.

## Solution

We've implemented a cleaner, more standard approach:

1. Added proper `__init__.py` files to ensure complete Python package structure:
   - `src/__init__.py` (newly added)
   - `src/local_newsifier/__init__.py` (already existed)
   - `src/local_newsifier/api/__init__.py` (already existed)

2. Updated railway.json to use Python's module notation to start the app:
   ```
   python -m uvicorn src.local_newsifier.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

3. Added healthcheck configuration for better deployment stability:
   ```json
   "healthcheckPath": "/health",
   "healthcheckTimeout": 60
   ```

## Advantages of This Approach

1. Uses Python's native import system without hacks or environment variables
2. Works consistently across all environments
3. No need for pip installation steps
4. Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
5. Follows Python packaging best practices
6. Adds health check monitoring for better deployment reliability

## Testing

This change provides a more robust solution to the import path issues while maintaining proper Python package structure and following Railway deployment best practices.
