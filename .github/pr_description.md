# Integrate Entity Service with Existing Code

## Problem

We had successfully implemented a vertical slice of the refactored architecture with the EntityService, but it wasn't integrated with the existing code. This made it difficult to verify if the refactored components were working correctly with the rest of the system.

## Solution

1. Created an ArticleService to handle article-related operations
2. Created a NewsPipelineService to coordinate the entire pipeline
3. Updated the NewsPipelineFlow to use the service layer
4. Added integration tests to verify the components work together
5. Created a demo script to showcase the new service layer

## Changes

- Added `ArticleService` class that uses the `EntityService` for processing articles
- Added `NewsPipelineService` class that coordinates the entire pipeline
- Updated `WebScraperTool` to add a `scrape_url` method that returns a dictionary
- Updated `NewsPipelineFlow` to use the service layer
- Added integration tests for the updated components
- Created a demo script to showcase the new service layer
- Fixed database integration issues with proper field names in models
- Improved error handling in the demo script for database schema issues
- Added support for processing articles from files with unique URLs

## Testing

All tests are passing, confirming that our implementation is correct. The integration tests verify that the components work together as expected.

## Related Issues

This integrates the vertical slice of the refactored architecture with the existing code, allowing us to verify that the new components work correctly with the rest of the system.
