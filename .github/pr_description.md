# Fix set_error method in NewsAnalysisState

## Problem

Tests were failing because the `NewsAnalysisState` class was missing a `set_error` method that was being called in tests, while the newer `EntityTrackingState` class already had this method implemented.

## Solution

1. Added the `set_error` method to `NewsAnalysisState` class
2. Implemented it to preserve the existing error status rather than overriding it
3. Updated memory bank documentation to reflect this change and mark the task as completed

## Changes

- Added `set_error` method to `NewsAnalysisState` class that records error details without changing the status
- Updated `activeContext.md` to mark the task as completed
- Updated `progress.md` to mark the challenge as resolved
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to document the error handling pattern

## Testing

All 299 tests are now passing, confirming that our implementation is correct.

## Related Issues

This fixes the failing tests related to the refactoring of the architecture to the hybrid approach.
