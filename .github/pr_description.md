# Implement Phase 1 of Hybrid Architecture: Tool Refactoring

This PR implements the first phase of our hybrid architecture approach, focusing on tool refactoring to create single-responsibility components without database operations.

## Changes

### New Tools with Single Responsibility

1. **EntityExtractor**
   - Extracts entities from text content
   - Supports filtering by entity type
   - Provides context extraction
   - No database operations

2. **ContextAnalyzer**
   - Analyzes the context of entity mentions
   - Performs sentiment analysis
   - Performs framing analysis
   - No database operations

3. **EntityResolver**
   - Resolves entities to canonical forms
   - Normalizes entity names
   - Calculates name similarity
   - No database operations

### Comprehensive Tests

- Added test suites for each refactored tool
- 7 tests for EntityExtractor
- 9 tests for ContextAnalyzer
- 9 tests for EntityResolver
- All tests are passing

### Memory Bank Updates

- Updated activeContext.md with the hybrid architecture approach
- Updated systemPatterns.md with the new architecture patterns
- Updated progress.md with the implementation plan and current status

## Implementation Details

The refactored tools follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each tool focuses on one specific task
2. **No Database Operations**: Tools perform pure processing without database access
3. **Clear Input/Output Contracts**: Tools have well-defined interfaces
4. **Composition-Based Design**: Tools can be composed together

## Next Steps

This PR completes Phase 1 of our hybrid architecture implementation plan. The next phases are:

1. **Phase 2**: Repository Layer Implementation
2. **Phase 3**: Service Layer Implementation
3. **Phase 4**: Flow Refactoring
4. **Phase 5**: Documentation and Integration

## Testing

All tests for the refactored tools are passing:

```
poetry run pytest tests/tools/extraction/test_entity_extractor.py -v
poetry run pytest tests/tools/analysis/test_context_analyzer.py -v
poetry run pytest tests/tools/resolution/test_entity_resolver.py -v
```
