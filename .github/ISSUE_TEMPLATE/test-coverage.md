## Coverage Issue

**Component**: <!-- Name of component, file or module with coverage gaps -->

**Current Coverage**: <!-- Current test coverage percentage -->

**Target Coverage**: <!-- Target coverage percentage to achieve -->

## Coverage Gaps

<!-- List the specific functions, methods, or code paths that lack adequate testing -->

- [ ] Function/Method: <!-- Name of function or method missing coverage -->
  - Missing coverage for: <!-- Describe specific scenarios or code paths not covered -->

## Proposed Solutions

<!-- Suggest ways to improve test coverage -->

- [ ] Add unit tests for: <!-- Specific functions or scenarios -->
- [ ] Add integration tests for: <!-- Specific component interactions -->
- [ ] Mock dependencies to test error handling paths

## Background Information

<!-- Add any relevant context about why testing this area is challenging -->

## Priority Level

- [ ] High: Blocking other work or critical functionality
- [ ] Medium: Important but not blocking
- [ ] Low: Nice to have

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Coverage for the specified component exceeds target percentage
- [ ] All identified gaps have corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests pass locally and in CI
