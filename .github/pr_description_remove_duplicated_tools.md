# Remove Redundant Analysis Tools

This PR removes redundant analysis tools that have been consolidated into the new `TrendAnalyzer` and `AnalysisService` components. It's part of our ongoing architecture refactoring to reduce code duplication and ensure better separation of concerns.

## Changes

### Removed Components:

1. **HeadlineTrendAnalyzer** (`tools/analysis/headline_analyzer.py`)
   - Functionality consolidated into `TrendAnalyzer`
   - Database access moved to CRUD modules

2. **TrendDetector** (`tools/trend_detector.py`)
   - Entity trend detection moved to `AnalysisService.detect_entity_trends()`
   - Now uses the consolidated `TrendAnalyzer` for analysis operations

3. **TopicFrequencyAnalyzer** (`tools/topic_analyzer.py`)
   - Statistical analysis capabilities moved to `TrendAnalyzer`
   - DB queries replaced with CRUD operations in `AnalysisService`

4. **HistoricalDataAggregator** (`tools/historical_aggregator.py`)
   - Data retrieval functionality migrated to CRUD modules
   - Time interval handling moved to `TrendAnalyzer` and `AnalysisService`

### Updated Flow Components:

1. **HeadlineTrendFlow** (`flows/analysis/headline_trend_flow.py`)
   - Now uses `AnalysisService` instead of `HeadlineTrendAnalyzer`
   - Same functionality with better architecture

2. **NewsTrendAnalysisFlow** (`flows/trend_analysis_flow.py`)
   - Now uses `AnalysisService` instead of directly using tools
   - Removed dependencies on the deleted components

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
   - Eliminated ~1,500 lines of duplicated code
   - Consolidated similar functionality into single components

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Analysis logic decoupled from database access
   - Flows now coordinate between services rather than tools

3. **Improved Testability**
   - Fewer direct DB dependencies in tools
   - Clean interfaces between components

4. **Simplified Architecture**
   - More consistent with our target architecture
   - Clearer relationships between components

## Testing

- All existing tests for these features have been migrated to test the new components
- Verified that `demo_trend_analysis.py` works correctly with the new implementation
- No regressions introduced in headline or entity trend analysis
