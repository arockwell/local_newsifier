# Webhook Fix Analysis

## Summary
PR #760 had the correct fix implemented but was failing tests because one test was outdated. The fix has been completed successfully.

## Problem
The `/webhooks/apify` endpoint was failing with:
```
RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'AnyIO worker thread'
```

This occurred when `fastapi-injectable` tried to resolve the session dependency in a thread without an event loop.

## Solution
1. Remove `@injectable` decorator from `get_session` in `di/providers.py` (already done in PR)
2. Update `api/dependencies.py` to use database engine's `get_session` directly (already done in PR)
3. Fix the failing test in `tests/api/test_dependencies.py` that expected the old behavior

## Key Changes Made
```python
# tests/api/test_dependencies.py
# Changed from: testing that get_session uses injectable provider
# Changed to: testing that get_session uses database engine directly
def test_get_session_from_database_engine(self):
    """Test that get_session uses the database engine's get_session."""
    # Now patches database.engine.get_session instead of di.providers.get_session
```

## Test Results
- All 769 tests pass
- Webhook endpoint works correctly
- No more async event loop errors

## Lessons Learned
1. The hybrid DI approach works well: use FastAPI's built-in DI for simple dependencies (like sessions) and `fastapi-injectable` for complex services
2. When changing implementation patterns, always check that tests match the new behavior
3. The previous developer had the right fix but missed updating the test

## Recommendation
Push this fix to PR #760 as it completes the implementation correctly.
