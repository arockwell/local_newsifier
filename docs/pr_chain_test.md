# PR Chain Test

This is a test file to validate that our CI workflow runs tests on PRs targeting other PRs.

## Purpose

This file doesn't have any functional purpose other than to:

1. Create a change in a new branch
2. Create a PR targeting the branch from Issue #292
3. Verify that GitHub Actions runs tests on this PR
4. Confirm that a comment with test results is posted on the PR

## How to Verify

After creating the PR, check:

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
- [ ] Tests run successfully
- [ ] A comment is posted with test results
- [ ] PR shows appropriate status checks

If all these criteria are met, the implementation is working correctly.
