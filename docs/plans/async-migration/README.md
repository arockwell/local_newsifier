# Async Migration Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for migrating the Local Newsifier codebase from its current mixed async/sync architecture to a consistent pattern.

## Document Overview

### 1. Analysis Documents
- **[async-sync-crash-analysis.md](async-sync-crash-analysis.md)** - Root cause analysis of production crashes due to async/sync mixing
- **[async-patterns-analysis.md](async-patterns-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive architectural analysis of current async patterns and issues
- **[async-antipatterns-catalog.md](async-antipatterns-catalog.md)** - Catalog of specific antipatterns found in the codebase with examples

### 2. Migration Plans
- **[async-sync-fix-plan.md](async-sync-fix-plan.md)** - Immediate fix plan with two options (quick sync fix vs full async migration)
- **[async-migration-guide.md](async-migration-guide.md)** - Detailed implementation guide with three migration strategies
- **[async-migration-patterns.md](async-migration-patterns.md)** - Technical patterns guide showing correct async/sync patterns

## Quick Start

If you're working on async-related issues:

1. **For immediate crash fixes**: Start with [async-sync-fix-plan.md](async-sync-fix-plan.md)
2. **For understanding patterns**: Read [async-migration-patterns.md](async-migration-patterns.md)
3. **For avoiding common mistakes**: Review [async-antipatterns-catalog.md](async-antipatterns-catalog.md)

## Related Plans

These documents work in conjunction with:
- [../convert_to_async.md](../convert_to_async.md) - Main async conversion plan
- [../event-loop-stabilization.md](../event-loop-stabilization.md) - Event loop cleanup efforts
- [../event-loop-remaining-work.md](../event-loop-remaining-work.md) - Specific files needing cleanup

## Current Status

- **Problem**: Mixed async/sync architecture causing production crashes
- **Root Cause**: FastAPI endpoints marked as `async` but using synchronous database sessions
- **Impact**: Application crashes when dependency injection tries to bridge sync/async gap
- **Solution**: Either convert everything to sync (quick fix) or migrate to full async (recommended)

## Migration Priority

Based on our analysis, the recommended approach is:

1. **Immediate**: Apply quick sync fix to stop production crashes
2. **Short-term**: Begin phased async migration following the patterns guide
3. **Long-term**: Complete full async migration for better performance and scalability

## Key Decisions

1. **Use native async** instead of thread pool executors for service migration
2. **Maintain consistency** - don't mix async and sync in the same router
3. **Test thoroughly** - async code requires different testing patterns
4. **Follow patterns** - use the documented patterns to avoid common pitfalls
