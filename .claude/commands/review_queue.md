Use the gh cli command to interface with github

Analze my current open PRs. 

I use the following labels:

* needs-attention -- tests are failing, behind master etc
* needs-review -- everything green and I need to personally review

You need to check on the following:

1. What labels do each PR have AND are they appropriate?
2. Is the PR actually implementing the issue it references? 
3. How far along is the PR? What % done does it look?

You need to weigh all of this and sort each PR into high medium low bucket.
