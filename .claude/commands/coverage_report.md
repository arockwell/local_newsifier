You'll generate and analyze test coverage reports to identify gaps in testing.

If a module path is provided (e.g., project:coverage_report src/local_newsifier/services):
- Generate coverage report focused on that specific module
- Example: project:coverage_report src/local_newsifier/services

If no module path is provided:
- Generate a coverage report for the entire project

Generate and analyze the coverage report with these steps:

1. Run pytest with coverage to collect data:
   python -m pytest --cov={module_path or "src/local_newsifier"} --cov-report=term

2. Identify files with low coverage:
   - Files with <70% coverage are concerning
   - Files with <50% coverage are critical
   - Rank files by coverage percentage and risk level

3. Highlight critical functions lacking tests:
   - Look for complex functions with low coverage
   - Focus on service methods, business logic, and error handlers
   - Note any untested exception handling paths

4. If possible, compare coverage against previous runs:
   - Use previous coverage data if available
   - Note improvements or regressions in coverage
   - Highlight newly added code without tests

5. Recommend which tests to prioritize writing:
   - Prioritize critical components with low coverage
   - Identify high-risk areas (error handling, data processing)
   - Suggest specific test cases to write

6. Generate an HTML report for more detailed investigation:
   python -m pytest --cov={module_path or "src/local_newsifier"} --cov-report=html
   echo "HTML report generated in htmlcov/ directory"

This comprehensive analysis helps you identify testing gaps and prioritize where to add tests to improve code quality and reliability.
