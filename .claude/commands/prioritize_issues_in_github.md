You'll prioritize GitHub issues to help organize the work.

If a label is provided as an argument (e.g., project:prioritize_issues_in_github bug):
- Focus on issues with that specific label
- Use "gh issue list --label $ARGUMENTS" to find relevant issues

If no label is provided:
- Review all open issues
- Use "gh issue list" to see all open issues

You need to do a few things:

1. Assess if the issues is being worked on. Make sure it has the in-progress label
2. Conversely, remove the in-progress label if they are not
3. Prioritize the issues. Figure out what is most important.

Look at the different label tags to look for different work groups.

Make EIGHT work streams.

Yes, EIGHT work streams.

Do your best, this isn't always possible. Suggest new issues if necessary to get there.

You need to classify work on these dimensions:

PRIORITY: low medium high
DIFFICULTY: low medium high
IMPACT: low medium high

Look for quick wins, but accept that most truly big wins are difficult.
