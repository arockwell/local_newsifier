Switch to main, pull main

Make a new branch

Using gh issue look for $ARGUMENTS

Analyze the issue. Think hard about the description. Not all issues are created equal.
You need to think about:

1. Scope. Can we solve the issue in a MAX of 1-2k lines. Less than 500 lines preferred
2. Sensibility. Do we reall need it? Do we still need it? Is it worth it?
3. Feasibilty. HOw difficult will it be to implement?

If you think the issue will be too hard as written, propose a way to restructure 
the work. Maybe make new issues, or scope an issue down. 

If you DO think that the issue is in scope (and you should NORMALLY expect it to be)

Now try to think through how to BUILD. 

WHAT do we need?
HOW will we structure?
HOW will we test?

Make a thorough step-by-step plan and be ready to implement!
