Make sure you are on a branch immediately off of a freshly pulled main

You should have an plan already in your context that you need to implement. 

This is the ground rules for implementing.

PUSH THE FIRST COMMIT AND MAKE A PR IMMEDIALTELY

use the gh pr command on the cli to interface with github

Commit early, commit often

Before you push, TEST THE CODE

use poetry to test the code. 

TEST THE CODE FIRST.

Once the tests are working, PUSH. 

You need to monitor the PR until it completes. This can take up to five mintues. 

PLEASE WAIT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ALERTING ME. I KNOW THAT'S A LONG TIME. YOU CAN DO IT!

If the build is failing, alert me with a plan for how to fix the build. 

NOTE, if you don't see the tests start, you probably need to resolve conflicts with main.

This is something you will want to check for. I can't merge your work other wise!
