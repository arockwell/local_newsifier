# Issue: Testing Support for Dependency Injection

## Title
Implement Standardized Testing Support for DI Container

## Description
Currently, our test suite lacks standardized patterns for working with the dependency injection container. Each test implements its own mocking approach, which leads to inconsistency and duplication. This issue focuses on creating a comprehensive testing infrastructure that makes it easy to test components that use the DI container, with proper mocking, isolation, and container lifecycle management.

## Current Status
- Tests use varied approaches to mock dependencies
- No standard container fixture for tests
- Container state can leak between tests
- Mocking service dependencies is verbose and repetitive
- Different test files use different patterns

## Tasks
1. Create standardized container test fixtures:
   - Implement a base container fixture for pytest
   - Add container reset/snapshot mechanisms between tests
   - Provide container isolation for parallel test execution
   - Create child container support for test-specific overrides

2. Implement service mocking helpers:
   - Create a standardized pattern for mocking container services
   - Provide utilities for creating mock services with correct interfaces
   - Add helpers for verifying service interactions
   - Support partial mocking of complex service dependencies

3. Add container state management for tests:
   - Add mechanisms to save and restore container state
   - Create container snapshots for test isolation
   - Provide container cloning for test-specific modifications
   - Implement automatic cleanup after test completion

4. Create test utilities for common patterns:
   - Add helpers for mocking database dependencies
   - Create utilities for simulating container failures
   - Provide tools for testing circular dependency resolution
   - Add helpers for testing service lifecycle hooks

5. Document testing patterns and best practices:
   - Add documentation for container testing patterns
   - Create examples of proper test setup and teardown
   - Document mocking best practices for different component types
   - Provide sample test cases for common scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- A standardized container fixture is available for tests
- Service mocking follows a consistent pattern
- Container state is isolated between tests
- Test utilities cover common testing scenarios
- Documentation includes clear examples and best practices
- Existing tests are updated to use the new testing infrastructure

## Technical Context
- Tests are implemented using pytest
- The DI container is defined in `src/local_newsifier/di_container.py`
- Different component types (services, flows, tools) may require different testing approaches
- The test fixtures should be placed in appropriate test fixture files (e.g., `tests/conftest.py`)
