# Dependency Injection System Follow-Up Issues

This directory contains issue definitions for enhancements to the Local Newsifier dependency injection system. These issues represent the next steps after completing the core service registration work in Issue #123.

## Overview

The Local Newsifier project has implemented a robust dependency injection (DI) system with service lifecycle management, circular dependency resolution, and parameterized factories. These follow-up issues define the work needed to fully leverage this system across all parts of the application.

## Issues

1. [**API Dependency Layer Enhancement**](./api_dependency_enhancement_issue.md)
   - Add dependencies for all services and flows
   - Implement request-scoped container functionality
   - Improve error handling and standardize patterns
   - Priority: High

2. [**DI Documentation Update**](./di_documentation_update_issue.md)
   - Document complete lifecycle of container usage
   - Standard patterns and conventions
   - Usage examples for different contexts
   - Error handling and fallback patterns
   - Priority: Medium

3. [**Testing Support for DI**](./testing_support_di_issue.md)
   - Standardized container test fixtures
   - Service mocking helpers
   - Container state management for tests
   - Test utilities for common patterns
   - Priority: Medium

## Implementation Strategy

These issues should be implemented in the following order:

1. First, enhance the API dependency layer to add support for all services and flows
2. Next, implement the testing support infrastructure to facilitate development
3. Finally, update the documentation to reflect the complete system

This approach ensures that the core functionality is implemented first, followed by the testing infrastructure needed to maintain quality, and finally the documentation to support ongoing development.
