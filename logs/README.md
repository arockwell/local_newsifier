# Debug Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the Local Newsifier application.

## Files

- `debug.log` - Contains detailed debug logs from all application components

## Log Levels

The application uses the following log levels:

- `DEBUG` - Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems
- `INFO` - Confirmation that things are working as expected
- `WARNING` - Indication that something unexpected happened, but the application is still working
- `ERROR` - Due to a more serious problem, the application has not been able to perform some function
- `CRITICAL` - A serious error, indicating that the application itself may be unable to continue running

## Usage

To view real-time logs, you can use the `tail` command:

```bash
tail -f logs/debug.log
```

This is particularly useful for debugging during RSS feed processing.
