# Local Newsifier Documentation

Welcome to the Local Newsifier project documentation. This site contains architectural documentation and design considerations.

## Architecture Documentation

- [Apify Integration Architecture](docs/apify_architecture.md)
- [Celery Integration](docs/celery_integration.md)
- [Database Diagnostics](docs/db_diagnostics.md)

## Implementation Guides

## Design Explorations

### Apify Integration Approaches

We are considering several approaches for integrating with the Apify platform:

#### Approach 1: Clean Architecture with SQLModel

A comprehensive approach with clear separation of concerns:

- Domain models using SQLModel
- Client interfaces using Protocol
- CRUD operations following existing patterns
- Service layer with dependency injection

#### Approach 2: Lightweight Integration

A more direct approach with less abstraction:

- Direct integration with Apify client
- Simplified service implementation
- Minimal abstraction layers

#### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach

Balanced approach combining elements from both:

- Key interfaces for testability
- Reduced abstraction where not needed
- Pragmatic implementation
