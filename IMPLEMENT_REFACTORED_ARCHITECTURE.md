# Implemented Refactored Architecture

This branch fully implements the refactored architecture outlined in the PR_README.md. The implementation includes real working components, tests, and documentation.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Implemented Core Components**
   - `SessionManager`: Provides centralized session handling with context manager pattern
   - `EntityService`: Encapsulates entity-related business logic
   - `SentimentService`: Encapsulates sentiment analysis business logic
   - Updated entity and sentiment tracking tools to use services
   - Implemented factories for dependency management

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Updated `engine.py` to maintain backward compatibility
   - Preserved old implementations for gradual migration
   - Added v2 suffixes to new implementations to avoid breaking changes

3. **Tests and Documentation**
   - Added unit tests for all new components
   - Created migration guide and examples
   - Added test runner script

## File by File Changes

### Core Infrastructure
- `src/local_newsifier/database/session_manager.py` - Centralized session handling
- `src/local_newsifier/database/engine.py` - Updated to delegate to SessionManager while maintaining compatibility

### Services
- `src/local_newsifier/services/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `src/local_newsifier/services/entity_service.py` - Entity management service
- `src/local_newsifier/services/sentiment_service.py` - Sentiment analysis service

### Refactored Tools
- `src/local_newsifier/tools/entity_tracker_v2.py` - Uses EntityService
- `src/local_newsifier/tools/sentiment_analyzer_v2.py` - Uses SentimentService

### Refactored Flows
- `src/local_newsifier/flows/entity_tracking_flow_v2.py` - Uses refactored tools
- `src/local_newsifier/flows/sentiment_analysis_flow_v2.py` - Uses refactored tools

### Factory & Core
- `src/local_newsifier/core/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `src/local_newsifier/core/factory.py` - Factories for component creation

### Tests
- `tests/test_refactored_architecture.py` - Tests for overall architecture
- `tests/services/test_entity_service.py` - Tests for EntityService
- `tests/services/test_sentiment_service.py` - Tests for SentimentService
- `tests/tools/test_sentiment_analyzer_v2.py` - Tests for SentimentAnalyzer V2

### Scripts & Documentation
- `scripts/demo_refactored_architecture.py` - Demonstrates using the new architecture
- `scripts/demo_sentiment_analysis_v2.py` - Showcases sentiment analysis with new architecture
- `scripts/migrate_to_new_architecture.py` - Guide for migrating existing code
- `REFACTORED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation guide
- `run_refactored_tests.sh` - Script to run all tests for the new architecture

## Migration Strategy

This implementation enables a gradual migration approach:

1. Start using `SessionManager` for new code
2. Create services for your domain areas
3. Refactor tools to use services
4. Update flows to use refactored tools

The `_v2` suffix pattern allows for safe parallel implementation while ensuring no existing code breaks during the transition.

## Running Tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
./run_refactored_tests.sh
```

## Demo Scripts

Try the new architecture with:

```bash
python scripts/demo_refactored_architecture.py
python scripts/demo_sentiment_analysis_v2.py
```

Learn about migration patterns with:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_new_architecture.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring other components
2. Gradually replace old components with the new ones
3. Update documentation and tests
4. Eventually remove the v2 suffix once migration is complete
