# Implemented Refactored Architecture

This branch fully implements the refactored architecture outlined in the PR_README.md, with an additional optimization to simplify the design. The implementation includes real working components, tests, and documentation.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Implemented Core Components with Simplified Design**
   - `SessionManager`: Provides centralized session handling with context manager pattern
   - `EntityService`: Contains all entity-related business logic (including functionality from EntityTracker)
   - `SentimentService`: Contains all sentiment analysis business logic
   - Flows use services directly without an intermediate tool layer
   - Implemented factories for dependency management

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Updated `engine.py` to maintain backward compatibility
   - Preserved old implementations for gradual migration
   - Added v2 suffixes to new implementations to avoid breaking changes
   - Created migration script with examples of how to transition code

3. **Tests and Documentation**
   - Added unit tests for all new components, focusing on services
   - Created comprehensive migration guide and examples
   - Added test runner script to verify implementation

## File by File Changes

### Core Infrastructure
- `src/local_newsifier/database/session_manager.py` - Centralized session handling
- `src/local_newsifier/database/engine.py` - Updated to delegate to SessionManager while maintaining compatibility

### Services (Core Business Logic)
- `src/local_newsifier/services/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `src/local_newsifier/services/entity_service.py` - Complete entity management service with processing logic
- `src/local_newsifier/services/sentiment_service.py` - Sentiment analysis service

### Specialized Tools (Only When Needed)
- `src/local_newsifier/tools/sentiment_analyzer_v2.py` - NLP capabilities that delegate to SentimentService

### Simplified Flows
- `src/local_newsifier/flows/entity_tracking_flow_v2.py` - Uses EntityService directly
- `src/local_newsifier/flows/sentiment_analysis_flow_v2.py` - Uses SentimentService through analyzer

### Factory & Core
- `src/local_newsifier/core/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `src/local_newsifier/core/factory.py` - Factories for service-focused component creation

### Tests
- `tests/test_refactored_architecture.py` - Tests for overall architecture
- `tests/services/test_entity_service.py` - Tests for EntityService including entity processing
- `tests/services/test_sentiment_service.py` - Tests for SentimentService
- `tests/tools/test_sentiment_analyzer_v2.py` - Tests for SentimentAnalyzer V2

### Scripts & Documentation
- `scripts/demo_refactored_architecture.py` - Demonstrates using the new architecture
- `scripts/demo_sentiment_analysis_v2.py` - Showcases sentiment analysis with new architecture
- `scripts/migrate_to_new_architecture.py` - Guide for migrating existing code with examples
- `REFACTORED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation guide for service-oriented design
- `run_refactored_tests.sh` - Script to run all tests for the new architecture

## Simplified Architecture

The architecture was simplified from the original PR by:

1. **Eliminating unnecessary layers**: Moved entity tracking logic directly into EntityService
2. **Promoting direct communication**: Flows now use Services directly instead of through a tool layer
3. **Focusing on business logic**: Services contain complete domain logic rather than split between services and tools
4. **Reducing complexity**: Fewer components with clearer responsibilities

## Migration Strategy

This implementation enables a gradual migration approach:

1. Start using `SessionManager` for new code
2. Create comprehensive services for each domain area
3. Move business logic from tools into services where appropriate
4. Update flows to use services directly

The `_v2` suffix pattern allows for safe parallel implementation while ensuring no existing code breaks during the transition. This approach also improves code coverage since more logic is centralized in testable service components.

## Running Tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
./run_refactored_tests.sh
```

## Demo Scripts

Try the new architecture with:

```bash
python scripts/demo_refactored_architecture.py
python scripts/demo_sentiment_analysis_v2.py
```

Learn about migration patterns with:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_new_architecture.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring other components
2. Gradually replace old components with the new ones
3. Update documentation and tests
4. Eventually remove the v2 suffix once migration is complete
