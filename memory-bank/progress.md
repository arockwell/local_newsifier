## Current Status

### Project Phase

The project is currently in the **Architecture Implementation** phase. We have successfully implemented a vertical slice of the hybrid architecture and integrated it with the existing code, including:

1. **EntityService** for coordinating entity processing
2. **ArticleService** for article processing
3. **NewsPipelineService** for coordinating the entire pipeline
4. **Refactored EntityTracker** that uses the service
5. **Updated EntityTrackingFlow** that uses the new tracker
6. **Updated NewsPipelineFlow** that uses the service layer
7. **Integration tests** for the complete flow
8. **Demo script** to showcase the new service layer

This vertical slice implementation validates the hybrid architecture approach and provides a pattern for implementing the rest of the architecture. The benefits we've already seen include:
- Improved separation of concerns
- Enhanced testability
- Clearer business logic boundaries
- More maintainable code organization
- Better error handling
