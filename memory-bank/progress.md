# Development Progress: Local Newsifier

## Completed Work

### Core Database Structure
- ✅ Implemented base models using SQLModel
- ✅ Created database schema with tables for articles, entities, analysis results
- ✅ Set up relationship models between entities
- ✅ Added database connection and session management
- ✅ Added Apify models for web scraping integration

### Entity Tracking System
- ✅ Implemented entity extraction from articles
- ✅ Added entity resolution for normalizing entity references
- ✅ Created context analysis for understanding entity mentions
- ✅ Built relationship mapping between entities

### Analysis Pipeline
- ✅ Implemented sentiment analysis
- ✅ Created trend detection and analysis
- ✅ Added headline analysis
- ✅ Built historical data aggregation

### Content Acquisition
- ✅ Implemented RSS feed scraping and processing
- ✅ Added Apify web scraping integration
- ✅ Created CLI commands for interacting with Apify API
- ✅ Built workflow for processing scraped content into articles

### Web Interface
- ✅ Implemented FastAPI server with basic routes
- ✅ Created Jinja2 templates for web interface
- ✅ Added database exploration views
- ✅ Fixed SQLModel parameter binding issue in database queries
  - Updated system.py to use correct query parameter binding method
  - Changed from `session.exec(query, params)` to `session.exec(query.bindparams(...))`

### System Structure
- ✅ Implemented dependency injection system for better management of component relationships
- ✅ Fixed circular import dependencies between modules
- ✅ Standardized tool, service, and flow registrations
- ✅ Improved session management to avoid "Instance is not bound to a Session" errors
- ✅ Switched from PostgreSQL to Redis for Celery broker and result backend

## Current Status
- Web app is running successfully locally
- Database tables can be viewed and explored through the web interface
- All major components are operational
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 90% (exceeding the required 87% threshold)
  - Added comprehensive tests for database engine (75% coverage, up from 55%)
  - Created extensive tests for RSS feed service (98% coverage, up from 27%)
  - Added tests for API tasks router
  - Fixed test mocking approach to better isolate database operations
- ✅ Apify integration is complete and functional
  - Models and database migrations created
  - Service class for API interaction implemented
  - CLI commands for testing and operations added

## Next Steps

### Deployment
- Set up Railway deployment
- Configure environment variables in Railway for database connection
- Test deployed application
- Monitor performance and stability

### Feature Enhancements
- Add more visualization options for trends
- Improve entity resolution accuracy
- Add user authentication for admin functions
- Implement scheduled scraping and analysis
- Enhance Apify integration with automatic article processing

## Known Issues
- ✅ Fixed: NoneType error during RSS feed processing with CLI commands
  - Added registration of article_service in the CLI command module
  - Created local ArticleService instance in RSSFeedService.process_feed as fallback
  - Resolves 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'create_article_from_rss_entry' errors
  - Fixed circular dependency issues between services by providing alternative code paths
  
- ✅ Fixed: "No task function available" errors in CLI mode
  - Implemented direct_process_article function in the CLI commands
  - Bypassed Celery task infrastructure for CLI operations
  - Process articles synchronously during CLI feed processing
  - Added feedback in the terminal for each processed article

- ✅ Fixed: SQLAlchemy "Instance is not bound to a Session" error during RSS feed processing
  - Changed ArticleService.create_article_from_rss_entry() to return article ID instead of SQLModel object
  - Updated task code to work with IDs instead of SQLModel objects
  - Prevents detached session issues when objects are accessed outside their originating session

- ✅ Fixed: Celery worker and beat startup errors with "KeyError: 'No such transport: postgresql'"
  - Changed from PostgreSQL to Redis for Celery message broker and result backend
  - Redis is natively supported by Celery without requiring special adapters
  - Added redis package to requirements.txt and Poetry dependencies

- ✅ Fixed: Railway deployment health check failures for Celery processes
  - Updated railway.json to disable health checks for worker and beat processes
  - Added process-specific configurations instead of global health check settings
  - Specified health checks only for the web process that provides HTTP endpoints

## Deployment Notes
- Railway deployment requires environment variables for database connection
- Application is configured to use PostgreSQL for production
- Both railway.json and Procfile are properly configured
- Celery requires Redis for message broker and result backend
- Apify integration requires an API token to be set
