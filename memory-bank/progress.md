## Current Status

### Project Phase

The project is currently in the **Architecture Redesign** phase. The core functionality is implemented and working, but we're planning a significant architectural refactoring to implement a hybrid approach that combines:

1. Improved tool APIs with single responsibility
2. Dedicated repository layer for database operations
3. Service layer for business logic and coordination
4. Simplified flows for orchestration

This hybrid architecture will improve:
- Separation of concerns
- Code organization
- Testability
- Maintainability
- Future extensibility

### Implementation Plan

The implementation plan for the hybrid architecture consists of five phases:

1. **Phase 1: Tool Refactoring (3-4 weeks)**
   - Analyze current tools to identify core responsibilities
   - Design standardized interfaces for each tool category
   - Refactor tools to have single responsibilities
   - Remove database operations from tools
   - Update tests for refactored tools

2. **Phase 2: Repository Layer Implementation (3-4 weeks)**
   - Define repository interfaces
   - Implement base repository class
   - Create specialized repositories for each entity type
   - Move database logic from CRUD modules to repositories
   - Implement transaction management in repositories
   - Update tests for repositories

3. **Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation (3-4 weeks)**
   - Define service interfaces
   - Implement base service class
   - Create services for entity tracking, article processing, and analysis
   - Move business logic from flows to services
   - Implement proper transaction boundaries
   - Write tests for services

4. **Phase 4: Flow Refactoring (2-3 weeks)**
   - Update flows to use services
   - Simplify flow logic
   - Ensure consistent error handling
   - Update tests for flows

5. **Phase 5: Documentation and Integration (2-3 weeks)**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Perform integration testing

### Current Challenges

1. **Architectural Refactoring**:
   - Ensuring backward compatibility during refactoring
   - Maintaining test coverage during refactoring
   - Balancing improved architecture with implementation timeline
   - Coordinating changes across multiple layers

2. **Entity Resolution**:
   - Improving accuracy for ambiguous entity references
   - Balancing precision and recall in entity matching
   - Handling entity evolution over time

3. **Performance Optimization**:
