# Progress Tracking

## Testing Progress

### Test Coverage (as of April 20, 2025)
- **Flow Module Coverage**: 81% overall (559 statements, 104 missed)
- **Individual Module Coverage**:
  - `headline_trend_flow.py`: 100% (86/86 statements)
  - `trend_analysis_flow.py`: 92% (96/104 statements)
  - `entity_tracking_flow_service.py`: 100% (23/23 statements)
  - `news_pipeline.py`: 96% (87/91 statements)
  - `public_opinion_flow.py`: 94% (122/130 statements)
  - `rss_scraping_flow.py`: 100% (35/35 statements)
  - `entity_tracking_flow.py`: 0% (0/84 statements) - not currently tested

### Fixed Tests
- Fixed tests in `tests/flows/analysis/test_headline_trend_flow.py`
- Fixed tests in `tests/flows/test_trend_analysis_flow.py`
- Enhanced test coverage in `tests/flows/test_entity_tracking_flow_service.py`

### Remaining Test Issues
- `entity_tracking_flow.py` has 0% test coverage
  - Used only in demo scripts
  - Duplicates some functionality with `entity_tracking_flow_service.py`
  - Would require significant refactoring or new approach to testing
- Minor coverage gaps in `news_pipeline.py`, `public_opinion_flow.py`, and `trend_analysis_flow.py`

## Architectural Insights

### Code Duplication
- Entity tracking functionality is split between `entity_tracking_flow.py` and `entity_tracking_flow_service.py`
- The latter represents a cleaner, state-based approach but lacks some features
- Need to consolidate these implementations or remove the older one if not needed

### Testing Challenges
- The `@with_session` decorator complicates testing by injecting new sessions
- Direct database access in many flows makes mocking difficult
- Need for better isolation between components
- State-based testing has proven more effective than trying to mock low-level database operations

## Feature Status

### Headline Trend Analysis
- Fully implemented and tested
- Reports can be generated in various formats
- Proper cleanup of resources

### Trend Analysis
- Mostly implemented and tested
- Can handle different time frames
- Error handling works correctly

### Entity Tracking
- Implemented in two different approaches
- Basic functionality works but needs consolidation
- Dashboard and relationship detection only in older implementation
