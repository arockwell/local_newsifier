## Current Status

### Project Phase

The project is currently in the **Refactoring and Enhancement** phase. The core functionality is implemented and working, but the architecture is being refactored to improve:

1. Separation of concerns
2. Code organization
3. Testability
4. Maintainability

### Key Metrics

1. **Code Coverage**: ~90% (estimated based on test files)
2. **Component Completion**:
   - Models: 95% complete
   - Tools: 90% complete
   - Flows: 85% complete
   - CRUD: 95% complete
   - Tests: 80% complete

3. **Documentation Status**:
   - Code documentation: 85% complete
   - User documentation: 60% complete
   - API documentation: 40% complete

### Current Challenges

1. **Architectural Refactoring**:
   - Ensuring backward compatibility during model restructuring
   - Maintaining test coverage during refactoring
   - Updating all references to use new model paths

2. **Entity Resolution**:
   - Improving accuracy for ambiguous entity references
   - Balancing precision and recall in entity matching
   - Handling entity evolution over time

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reducing NLP processing overhead
   - Optimizing database queries for entity relationships
   - Handling large volumes of articles efficiently

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture

The project initially used a simpler architecture with:
- Monolithic model definitions
- Direct database access
- Limited error handling
- Basic entity extraction

### Current Architecture

The architecture has evolved to include:
- Separated model definitions with clear relationships
- Repository pattern for database access
- Comprehensive error handling and state management
- Sophisticated entity tracking and analysis

### Future Direction

The project is moving toward:
- More modular and pluggable components
- Enhanced NLP capabilities
- Better visualization and reporting
- API-first approach for integration

## Recent Milestones

   - Separation of models into dedicated files
   - Implementation of proper relationships
   - Enhanced type annotations and documentation

2. **Entity Tracking Enhancements**:
   - Improved entity resolution
   - Context analysis for entity mentions
   - Sentiment tracking for entities

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Integration tests for database relationships
   - Unit tests for CRUD operations
   - Test fixtures for database testing

4. **Headline Analysis**:
   - Implementation of trend detection
   - Temporal analysis of keyword frequency
