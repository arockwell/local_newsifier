# Project Progress

## Current Status

We are implementing a hybrid architecture with improved tool APIs, CRUD modules, and a service layer. Our current focus is on refactoring the application to follow these architectural patterns consistently.

## What Works

- **Core Data Models**:
  - SQLModel-based ORM is working well for database modeling
  - Article, Entity, and AnalysisResult models are all functional

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Base CRUD implementation provides consistent patterns
  - Entity, Article, and AnalysisResult CRUD operations working
  - Date-based and relationship queries now working

- **Service Layer**:
  - Article service for article management
  - Entity service for entity operations
  - News pipeline service for coordinating article processing
  - Analysis service for trend analysis (new)

- **Tools**:
  - Web scraper for fetching articles
  - Entity extraction for NER  
  - Entity resolution for matching similar entities
  - Context analysis for understanding entity mentions
  - Trend analyzer for tracking key trends (new consolidated tool)

- **Flows**:
  - News pipeline for end-to-end article processing
  - Entity tracking for associating entities across articles
  - Public opinion analysis

## What's Left to Build

1. **Refactor Remaining Tools**:
   - Continue refactoring remaining tools to remove direct database access
   - Consolidate overlapping functionality where needed

2. **Flow Improvements**:
   - Update flows to use service layer instead of accessing tools directly
   - Add proper error handling and logging

3. **User Interface**:
   - Develop API endpoints
   - Create web dashboard for viewing trends and insights

4. **Testing**:
   - Expand test coverage for new components
   - Add integration tests for entire system

## Recently Completed

1. **Analysis Tools Consolidation**:
   - Created consolidated `TrendAnalyzer` to replace multiple overlapping tools
   - Implemented `AnalysisService` to coordinate trend analysis operations
   - Added date-based queries to CRUD modules
   - Created demo script to showcase the new functionality
   - Added comprehensive tests for the new components

2. **CRUD Module Improvements**:
   - Enhanced `CRUDEntity` with date-range queries
   - Enhanced `CRUDArticle` with date-range queries
   - Fixed session handling across services

## Known Issues

- Some tools still directly access the database
- Inconsistent session management patterns in some areas
- Duplicated functionality between older tools

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Initial Architecture**: Started with a direct database access approach where tools directly accessed the database

2. **Current Hybrid Architecture**:
   - CRUD modules for database access
   - Tools for processing and analysis logic
   - Services to coordinate between CRUD and tools
   - Flows to orchestrate end-to-end processes

3. **Session Management**:
   - Evolved from passing sessions implicitly to explicit session management
   - Now using context managers for proper transaction handling

4. **Tool Design**:
   - Moving away from tools directly accessing database
   - Tools now accept input data as parameters
   - Tools return structured results for services to handle
