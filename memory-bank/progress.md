# Progress Tracking

## Testing Progress

### Test Coverage (as of April 20, 2025)
- **Flow Module Coverage**: 81% overall (559 statements, 104 missed)
- **Individual Module Coverage**:
  - `headline_trend_flow.py`: 100% (86/86 statements)
  - `trend_analysis_flow.py`: 92% (96/104 statements)
  - `entity_tracking_flow_service.py`: 100% (23/23 statements)
  - `news_pipeline.py`: 96% (87/91 statements)
  - `public_opinion_flow.py`: 94% (122/130 statements)
  - `rss_scraping_flow.py`: 100% (35/35 statements)
  - `entity_tracking_flow.py`: 0% untested â†’ now refactored to use service layer

### Fixed Tests
- Fixed tests in `tests/flows/analysis/test_headline_trend_flow.py`
- Fixed tests in `tests/flows/test_trend_analysis_flow.py`
- Enhanced test coverage in `tests/flows/test_entity_tracking_flow_service.py`
- Added comprehensive tests for the refactored `entity_tracking_flow.py`

### Remaining Test Issues
- Minor coverage gaps in `news_pipeline.py`, `public_opinion_flow.py`, and `trend_analysis_flow.py`
- Overall flow module test coverage is at 81%, short of our 90% goal

## Architectural Improvements

### State-Based Pattern
- Introduced specialized state classes for different operations:
  - `EntityTrackingState` - For single article processing
  - `EntityBatchTrackingState` - For batch processing of articles
  - `EntityDashboardState` - For dashboard generation
  - `EntityRelationshipState` - For entity relationship analysis
- State objects encapsulate input parameters, results, and operation status
- Improves separation of concerns and testability

### Service Layer Enhancement
- Enhanced `EntityService` with new methods:
  - `process_article_with_state()` - Process single article using state
  - `process_articles_batch()` - Process multiple articles with state tracking
  - `generate_entity_dashboard()` - Generate entity dashboard with state
  - `find_entity_relationships()` - Find relationships with state tracking
- Service layer now handles all business logic and database operations
- Flows delegate to services rather than accessing database directly

### Flow Refactoring
- Refactored `EntityTrackingFlow` to use the enhanced service
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing scripts
- Simplified flow implementation while preserving functionality

## Feature Status

### Entity Tracking
- Fully implemented and refactored
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Now follows state-based pattern
- Can track entities across articles, generate dashboards, and find relationships

### Headline Trend Analysis
- Fully implemented and tested
- Reports can be generated in various formats
- Proper cleanup of resources

### Trend Analysis
- Mostly implemented and tested
- Can handle different time frames
- Error handling works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Address minor coverage gaps in:
     - `news_pipeline.py` (4 statements)
     - `public_opinion_flow.py` (8 statements)
     - `trend_analysis_flow.py` (8 statements)
   - Aim to reach 90% overall coverage for flow module

2. **Extend State-Based Pattern**
   - Apply state-based pattern to other complex workflows
   - Create specialized state classes for news pipeline and trend analysis
   - Refactor other flows to use services and state objects

3. **Phase Out Direct Database Access**
   - Move all database operations to service layer
   - Eliminate `@with_session` decorator in flow components
   - Improve testability across the codebase
