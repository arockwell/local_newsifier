# Active Context: Local Newsifier

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on implementing a refactored architecture as indicated by the open VSCode tabs and visible files (`IMPLEMENT_REFACTORED_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `REFACTORED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`). This refactoring involves:

1. **Hybrid Architecture Implementation**: Planning and implementing a hybrid architecture approach that combines:
   - Improved tool APIs with single responsibility
   - Dedicated repository layer for database operations
   - Service layer for business logic and coordination
   - Simplified flows for orchestration

2. **Model Restructuring**: Reorganizing the database models for better separation of concerns
   - Separation of database models into dedicated files
   - Implementation of proper relationships between models
   - Enhanced type annotations and documentation

3. **Entity Tracking Improvements**: Enhancing the entity tracking functionality
   - Improved entity resolution across articles
   - Context analysis for entity mentions
   - Sentiment tracking for entities

4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Expanding test coverage for the refactored components
   - Integration tests for database relationships
   - Unit tests for CRUD operations
   - Test fixtures for database testing

The open tabs suggest particular focus on:
- Database models (article, entity, analysis_result)
- CRUD operations for these models
- Entity tracking and analysis tools
- Test cases for database models and relationships

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are focused on implementing the hybrid architecture approach:

1. **Phase 1: Tool Refactoring (3-4 weeks)**:
   - Analyze current tools to identify core responsibilities
   - Design standardized interfaces for each tool category

   - Update tests for refactored tools

2. **Phase 2: Repository Layer Implementation (3-4 weeks)**:
   - Define repository interfaces
   - Implement base repository class
   - Create specialized repositories for each entity type
   - Move database logic from CRUD modules to repositories
   - Implement transaction management in repositories
   - Update tests for repositories

3. **Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation (3-4 weeks)**:
   - Define service interfaces
   - Implement base service class
   - Create services for entity tracking, article processing, and analysis
   - Move business logic from flows to services
   - Implement proper transaction boundaries
   - Write tests for services

4. **Phase 4: Flow Refactoring (2-3 weeks)**:
   - Update flows to use services
   - Simplify flow logic
   - Ensure consistent error handling
   - Update tests for flows

5. **Phase 5: Documentation and Integration (2-3 weeks)**:
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Perform integration testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Hybrid Architecture Approach**:
   - Balance between improved tool APIs and service layer
   - Separation of concerns between tools, repositories, and services
   - Gradual migration path to avoid disrupting existing functionality
   - Alignment with future Domain-Driven Design principles

2. **Tool API Design**:
   - Single responsibility principle for tools
   - Pure functions vs. stateful tools
   - Standardized input/output contracts
   - Composition-based design for flexibility

3. **Repository Layer Design**:
   - Generic base repository vs. specialized repositories
   - Transaction management approach
   - Query object pattern for complex queries
   - Handling of relationships and eager loading

4. **Service Layer Design**:
   - Business logic boundaries between services
   - Transaction scope and management
   - Error handling and reporting
   - Service composition and dependencies

5. **Database Model Structure**:
   - Whether to use SQLModel for all models or maintain some separation
   - How to handle circular imports between related models
   - Balancing normalization with query performance

6. **Entity Resolution Strategy**:
   - Threshold for entity name similarity matching
   - Handling of ambiguous entity references
   - Strategies for entity disambiguation

7. **Testing Approach**:
   - Use of mocks vs. actual database for testing
   - Isolation of test databases between test runs
   - Handling of environment variables in tests

8. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Balancing NLP processing depth with performance
   - Strategies for handling large article volumes
   - Indexing approaches for entity queries

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Hybrid Architecture Patterns**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle for tools
   - Repository Pattern for database access
   - Service Layer Pattern for business logic
   - Dependency Injection for flexible composition
   - Interface-based design for loose coupling

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation between models, tools, repositories, services, and flows
   - Consistent file naming and module structure
   - Type annotations throughout the codebase
   - Interface definitions separate from implementations

3. **Database Access**:
   - Repository pattern for database operations
   - Transaction management in repositories and services
   - Explicit relationship definitions in models
   - Query objects for complex queries

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent exception hierarchy
   - Proper transaction rollback on errors
   - Detailed error logging with context
   - Retry mechanisms for recoverable errors

5. **Testing Patterns**:
   - One test file per component
   - Clear, descriptive test names
   - Use of fixtures for test setup
   - Verification of both state and behavior
   - Mocking of dependencies for unit tests
