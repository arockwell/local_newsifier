# Active Context

## Current Focus

We're refactoring the application to implement a hybrid architecture with improved tool APIs, CRUD modules, and a service layer. Our current focus is on consolidating analysis tools to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability.

## Recent Changes

### Consolidated Analysis Architecture

We've implemented a consolidated analysis architecture that addresses several issues with our previous approach:

1. **Created AnalysisService**:
   - Centralized business logic for trend analysis
   - Coordinated CRUD operations and analysis tools
   - Encapsulated transaction management
   - Provided a clean API for flows

2. **Consolidated TrendAnalyzer**:
   - Combined functionality from multiple tools into a single tool
   - Eliminated duplicated code
   - Provided consistent APIs for different types of analysis
   - Removed direct database access from analysis logic

3. **Enhanced CRUD Operations**:
   - Added date-based entity and article retrieval methods
   - Implemented proper joins for cross-entity queries
   - Ensured consistent return type handling

## Active Decisions

1. **Service Layer Implementation**:
   - Services coordinate between CRUD operations and tools
   - Services manage transactions and session handling
   - Services provide a clean API for flows

2. **Tool API Design**:
   - Tools no longer access the database directly
   - Tools focus on specific data processing and analysis
   - Tools receive needed data via parameters
   - Tools return structured results

3. **Database Session Management**:
   - Using SessionManager as a context manager for proper session handling

## Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: 
   - Services coordinate business logic
   - Services depend on CRUD operations and tools
   - Services handle transaction management

2. **Repository Pattern** (via CRUD modules):
   - CRUD modules encapsulate database operations
   - CRUD modules provide a consistent interface for data access
   - CRUD modules hide SQL implementation details

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Services accept CRUD and tool dependencies
   - Default implementations are provided for convenience
   - Enables easy mocking for testing

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Session Management**:
   - `SessionManager` used for context-manager-based session handling
   - Services use context managers for transaction management
   - CRUD operations expect an active session to be provided

2. **Date-Based Queries**:
   - Entity retrieval by date range requires joining with Article
   - Article retrieval by date range uses published_at field

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Services handle database errors and provide clean error messages
   - Tools handle processing errors gracefully
