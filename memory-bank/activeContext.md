# Active Context

## Current Focus

We're focused on consolidating the entity tracking implementations to improve testability and maintainability:

1. We've refactored the `EntityTrackingFlow` to use a state-based pattern through the service layer
2. We've enhanced the `EntityService` with new capabilities to handle entity dashboard and relationship analysis
3. We've maintained backward compatibility to ensure existing demo scripts continue to function
4. We've expanded test coverage of the refactored code to ensure reliability

## Recent Changes

### Consolidating Entity Tracking Implementations
- Created specialized state classes for different entity tracking operations:
  - `EntityBatchTrackingState` - For batch processing of articles
  - `EntityDashboardState` - For dashboard generation
  - `EntityRelationshipState` - For entity relationship analysis
- Enhanced `EntityService` with new state-based methods
- Refactored `EntityTrackingFlow` to use the enhanced service
- Updated tests for all refactored components

### Testing Approach Enhancements
- For exception tests, we're using a more direct method to test the exception paths by patching the method and simulating the error conditions
- This approach is more reliable than trying to trigger the exceptions from the outside
- Learned that patching decorator-wrapped methods requires caution, especially with the `@with_session` decorator
- Fixed issues with mocking context managers for session handling in tests

## Next Steps

1. Consider how to further improve test coverage:
   - The overall flow module test coverage is at 81%, short of our 90% goal
   - Focus on the smaller coverage gaps in `news_pipeline.py`, `public_opinion_flow.py`, and `trend_analysis_flow.py`

2. Look for other opportunities to consolidate functionality:
   - Identify other duplicated implementations that could benefit from the state-based pattern
   - Apply the service layer pattern more consistently throughout the codebase

3. Eventually phase out direct database access in flow components in favor of the service layer

## Key Insights

1. The state-based pattern significantly improves testability and separation of concerns
2. Services should be the primary interface to database operations, not flows
3. Legacy code can be refactored incrementally while maintaining compatibility
4. The `@with_session` decorator complicates testing and may be better handled through service methods
5. Mock objects need to be created carefully, especially for context managers
