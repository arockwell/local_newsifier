# Active Context: Local Newsifier

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on implementing a refactored architecture and this refactoring involves:

1. **Hybrid Architecture Implementation**: Implementing a hybrid architecture approach that combines:
   - Improved tool APIs with single responsibility
   - CRUD modules for database operations
   - Service layer for business logic and coordination
   - Simplified flows for orchestration

   We have successfully implemented a vertical slice of this architecture with:
   - EntityService for coordinating entity processing
   - ArticleService for article processing
   - NewsPipelineService for coordinating the entire pipeline
   - Refactored EntityTracker that uses the service
   - Updated EntityTrackingFlow that uses the new tracker
   - Updated NewsPipelineFlow that uses the service layer
   - Integration tests for the complete flow

2. **Model Restructuring**: Reorganizing the database models for better separation of concerns
   - Separation of database models into dedicated files
   - Implementation of proper relationships between models
   - Enhanced type annotations and documentation

3. **Entity Tracking Improvements**: Enhancing the entity tracking functionality
   - Improved entity resolution across articles
   - Context analysis for entity mentions
   - Sentiment tracking for entities

4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Expanding test coverage for the refactored components
   - Integration tests for database relationships
   - Unit tests for CRUD operations
   - Test fixtures for database testing
   - Integration tests for the service layer

The open tabs suggest particular focus on:
- Database models (article, entity, analysis_result)
- CRUD operations for these models
- Entity tracking and analysis tools
- Service layer implementation
- Test cases for database models, relationships, and services

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Hybrid Architecture Patterns**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle for tools
   - CRUD modules for database access
   - Service Layer Pattern for business logic
   - Dependency Injection for flexible composition
   - Interface-based design for loose coupling

2. **Service Layer Implementation**:
   - Services coordinate between tools and CRUD modules
   - Services encapsulate business logic
   - Services manage transaction boundaries
   - Services provide a clean API for flows
   - Services use SessionManager for database access

3. **Tool Refactoring**:
   - Tools focus on specific processing tasks
   - Tools receive dependencies through constructor
   - Tools have clear input/output contracts
   - Tools are composable and reusable
   - Tools do not directly access the database

4. **State Management**:
   - State objects track processing status
   - State objects capture error details
   - State objects maintain audit logs
   - State objects enable resumable processing
   - State objects provide consistent error handling

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - TDD for new components
   - Integration tests for complete flows
   - Mock objects for isolated testing
   - In-memory database for data access testing
   - Comprehensive test coverage for the service layer
