# Active Context: Local Newsifier

## Current Focus
- Web interface functionality with correct database interaction
- Deployment configuration for Railway

## Recent Changes
- Fixed SQLModel parameter binding issue in system.py
  - Changed from `session.exec(query, params)` to `session.exec(query.bindparams(...))`
  - SQLModel's Session.exec() method takes only one parameter (the query itself)
  - Parameters must be bound to the query object before execution

## Technical Details

### Web Interface Status
- The web application is now working correctly
- Database tables can be viewed and explored through the browser
- Table details can be viewed with proper SQL queries

### Deployment Configuration
- Railway.json is properly configured:
  ```json
  {
    "build": {
      "builder": "NIXPACKS"
    },
    "deploy": {
      "startCommand": "uvicorn src.local_newsifier.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
      "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
      "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
    }
  }
  ```

- Procfile is set up for web process:
  ```
  web: uvicorn src.local_newsifier.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```

- Environment variables needed for deployment:
  - POSTGRES_USER
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
  - POSTGRES_HOST
  - POSTGRES_PORT
  - POSTGRES_DB

## Key Decisions

### Query Parameter Binding
We identified that SQLModel requires a different approach to parameter binding than what was initially implemented. The correct pattern is:

```python
# Original problematic code
columns = session.exec(column_query, {"table_name": table_name}).all()

# Fixed approach
column_query = column_query.bindparams(table_name=table_name)
columns = session.exec(column_query).all()
```

This change was made in the system.py router to fix the "Session.exec() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given" error.

## Next Steps

### For Railway Deployment
1. Create a Railway project and add the PostgreSQL plugin
2. Configure the required environment variables
3. Link the GitHub repository to Railway
4. Deploy the application
5. Verify that the web interface works correctly in production

### For Further Development
1. Add more visualization options for trends and entity relationships
2. Improve entity resolution accuracy
3. Implement scheduled scraping and analysis
4. Add user authentication for admin functions

## Key Learnings
1. SQLModel has different parameter binding requirements compared to SQLAlchemy
2. Parameter binding needs to happen before passing the query to session.exec()
3. Railway deployment requires proper configuration of both railway.json and Procfile
4. Database connection depends on environment variables being correctly set
