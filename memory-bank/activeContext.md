# Active Context

## Current Focus

We're focused on improving test coverage for the flows module. Specifically:

1. We've successfully fixed the tests for `headline_trend_flow.py` and `trend_analysis_flow.py`
2. We've improved test coverage with `headline_trend_flow.py` now at 100% coverage, `trend_analysis_flow.py` at 92% coverage, and `entity_tracking_flow_service.py` at 100% coverage
3. The overall flow module test coverage is at 81%, short of our 90% goal
4. `entity_tracking_flow.py` remains at 0% coverage, but we've determined it's used solely in the demo script and would require refactoring to properly test

## Recent Changes

### Test Coverage Improvements
- Fixed tests for the analysis flows
- Added proper exception testing in `test_trend_analysis_flow.py` with correct mocking approaches
- Improved the test for different time frame handling in `trend_analysis_flow.py`
- Added comprehensive tests for the entity_tracking_flow_service.py module
- Identified code paths requiring better testing

### Testing Approach Enhancements
- For exception tests, we're using a more direct method to test the exception paths by patching the method and simulating the error conditions
- This approach is more reliable than trying to trigger the exceptions from the outside
- Learned that patching decorator-wrapped methods requires caution, especially with the `@with_session` decorator

## Next Steps

1. Consider how to handle the older `entity_tracking_flow.py`:
   - It duplicates functionality with `entity_tracking_flow_service.py`, but has more features
   - It's currently used in the demo scripts
   - Long-term approach would be to either migrate its functionality to `entity_tracking_flow_service.py` or extract the unique functionality into dedicated service classes

2. Look at the smaller coverage gaps in:
   - `news_pipeline.py` (96% covered, missing 4 lines)
   - `public_opinion_flow.py` (94% covered, missing 8 lines)
   - `trend_analysis_flow.py` (92% covered, missing 8 lines)

3. Consider making a PR with the current fixes to ensure the tests are stable in the main branch

## Key Insights

1. The `@with_session` decorator in the `database/engine.py` file complicates testing because it opens a new session if one isn't provided
2. When using `patch.object()`, we need to be precise about which objects and methods to patch
3. Some of the tests were failing because we were trying to patch non-existent attributes
4. For error handling tests, it's often easier to directly create error states or patch methods to simulate errors rather than trying to induce errors through external means
5. We have duplicate implementations of entity tracking functionality that will need to be consolidated
