# Product Context: Local Newsifier

## Purpose

Local Newsifier exists to transform unstructured local news content into structured, analyzable data that reveals patterns, trends, and relationships in local news coverage. By focusing on Gainesville, FL news sources, the system provides insights into local issues, key figures, and evolving narratives that shape the community.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Information Overload

**Problem:** Local news is published across multiple sources at high volume, making it difficult for readers to identify important trends and patterns.

**Solution:** Local Newsifier aggregates and analyzes news content, extracting key entities and topics to provide a consolidated view of what's happening in the community.

### 2. Entity Tracking Challenges

**Problem:** Tracking mentions of specific people, organizations, or places across multiple news sources over time is labor-intensive and error-prone when done manually.

**Solution:** The system automatically identifies named entities in articles and tracks them across publications, building comprehensive profiles that show how entities are portrayed and how their presence in the news evolves.

### 3. Trend Identification

**Problem:** Identifying emerging trends in local news coverage typically requires reading numerous articles and manually noting patterns.

**Solution:** Local Newsifier's headline trend analysis automatically identifies trending terms and topics, showing how coverage evolves over time and highlighting emerging issues.

### 4. Contextual Understanding

**Problem:** Understanding the context and sentiment around how entities are portrayed in local news requires deep reading and analysis.

**Solution:** The system analyzes the context in which entities appear, extracting sentiment and framing information to provide insights into how entities are portrayed in local media.

### 5. Relationship Discovery

**Problem:** Connections between different entities in local news are often implicit and difficult to discover without extensive reading.

**Solution:** By tracking co-occurrences of entities across articles, the system can identify relationships and connections that might not be immediately obvious.

### 6. Data Accessibility

**Problem:** Accessing and visualizing database information typically requires specialized knowledge or custom tools.

**Solution:** Local Newsifier provides a user-friendly web interface to visualize and explore the database structure and content, along with RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access.
