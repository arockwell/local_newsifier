# Project Brief: Local Newsifier

## Project Overview

Local Newsifier is a robust system for fetching, analyzing, and storing local news articles from Gainesville, FL using crew.ai Flows. The system automatically fetches local news articles, performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis, and stores the results with a focus on reliability and observability.

## Core Requirements

1. **Automated News Processing**
   - Fetch news articles from specified sources
   - Extract and analyze article content
   - Store processed articles and analysis results
   - Track entities mentioned across articles

2. **Entity Recognition and Tracking**
   - Identify named entities in articles (people, organizations, locations)
   - Track entities across multiple articles over time
   - Analyze entity relationships and co-occurrences
   - Generate entity profiles with contextual information

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Analyze headline trends over time
   - Detect trending terms and topics
   - Track sentiment around specific entities
   - Generate trend reports in various formats

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for network failures
   - Handle parsing errors gracefully
   - Maintain state for workflow resumption
   - Log errors and exceptions comprehensively

5. **Data Persistence**
   - Store articles and analysis results in a database
   - Maintain entity relationships and tracking data
   - Support multiple database instances for development
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency

## Technical Goals

1. **Modularity**
   - Separate concerns into distinct components
   - Enable independent testing of components
   - Allow for easy extension and modification
   - Support pluggable analysis tools

2. **Reliability**
   - Ensure consistent processing of articles
   - Handle edge cases and unexpected inputs
   - Recover from failures automatically
   - Maintain data integrity

3. **Observability**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - State tracking and monitoring
   - Progress reporting
   - Error diagnostics

4. **Testability**
   - High test coverage (>90%)
   - Isolated component tests
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Mocking of external dependencies

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully fetch and process news articles from multiple sources
2. Accurately identify and track named entities across articles
3. Generate meaningful trend analysis reports
4. Maintain system reliability with proper error handling
5. Achieve high test coverage and code quality
6. Support multiple analysis types and report formats
