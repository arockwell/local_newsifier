# Complete fastapi-injectable provider implementations ✅

## Summary
This issue tracks the completion of the fastapi-injectable provider implementations to ensure consistent DI usage.

## Background
We are migrating from our custom DIContainer to fastapi-injectable as documented in issue #142, but there are still several tools and services that need proper provider implementations.

## Tools Added in The Current PR
- SentimentAnalyzer provider (get_sentiment_analyzer_tool)
- SentimentTracker provider (get_sentiment_tracker_tool)
- TrendAnalyzer provider (get_trend_analyzer_tool)
- TrendReporter provider (get_trend_reporter_tool)
- ContextAnalyzer provider (get_context_analyzer_tool)
- EntityTracker provider (get_entity_tracker_tool)
- EntityExtractor provider (get_entity_extractor_tool)
- EntityResolver provider (get_entity_resolver_tool)
- OpinionVisualizer provider (get_opinion_visualizer_tool)
- FileWriter provider (get_file_writer_tool)
- Added missing aliases with _tool suffix for consistent naming pattern

## Flow Classes Implemented
- Added base/derived pattern for all flow classes:
  - NewsPipelineFlow (NewsPipelineFlowBase)
  - EntityTrackingFlow (EntityTrackingFlowBase)
  - PublicOpinionFlow (PublicOpinionFlowBase)
  - TrendAnalysisFlow (NewsTrendAnalysisFlowBase)

## Advanced Patterns Implemented
- Base/derived class pattern for flow components
- Factory pattern for circular dependencies
- Consistent use of injectable decorators with use_cache=False
- See the new [Dependency Injection Patterns](docs/dependency_injection_tools.md) documentation for details

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ All analysis and extraction tools have consistent provider implementations
- ✅ All tools have _tool suffix versions for backwards compatibility
- ✅ Provider functions use appropriate caching strategy (use_cache=False for most tools)
- ✅ Documentation is updated to reflect new providers and patterns
- ✅ Tests are updated to use the new providers

## Implementation Details
- ✅ Consistent docstrings across all provider functions
- ✅ Maintained consistent pattern for naming and implementation
- ✅ Added proper error handling for tool initialization failures
- ✅ Separated business logic from dependency resolution with base/derived pattern
- ✅ Added factory functions to resolve circular dependencies
